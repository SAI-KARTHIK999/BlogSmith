# **App Name**: ContentCraft AI

## Core Features:

- Secure User Authentication: Allow users to securely sign up and log in using JWT-based authentication to protect their data and content.
- AI Content Generation: Enable users to generate content (blogs, tweets, emails, ad copies) by selecting a type, customizing parameters such as length and tone, and providing an initial prompt. This will be powered by the OpenAI API tool.
- Content History Display: Show a dashboard that lists the user's previously generated content, including the type of content, a snippet of the text, and the date of generation.
- Content Filtering: Let users filter and search their content history by content type or keywords.
- Content Actions: Add quick actions to each content item in the history, such as copying the text to the clipboard or downloading the content.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL 47, 90%, 54% (Hex: #F0D960) for an optimistic and engaging feel.
- Background color: HSL 47, 18%, 97% (Hex: #FAF7ED), creating a warm and inviting neutral base.
- Accent color: HSL 17, 71%, 54% (Hex: #E88337), providing clear contrast and guiding user attention to key interactive elements.
- Font pairing: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for headlines and 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for body text, offering a balanced, modern and readable appearance.
- Use a consistent set of line icons that reflect the content types (blog, tweet, email) in a minimalist style.
- Employ a clean and intuitive layout with a focus on content discoverability, using a grid system for the content history dashboard.
- Implement subtle transitions and animations (e.g., a fade-in effect when content is generated) to enhance user experience without being distracting.
